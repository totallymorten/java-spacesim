SpaceSim:

=======
FIX:
=======
- Engine should not write force output when not burning
- Engine should only consume small amount when not burning
- Reactor should not have unlimited supply pr turn (should be similar to power buffer)
- don't recalculate acc with energy unchanged

=======
NEW:
=======
+ add energy buffer
+ add engine burn / retroburn (secs)
- engine will use only 5% energy when not burning.

(add STATE to both reactor and engine)
	

- add thrusters to automatically adjust for speed [x,y,z]
	! so cmd "THRUSTERS SPEED [0,0,0]"
	! thrusters will have capability of 1 GW or something

- (add destination + estimated time to target + direction)

- add engine auto course adjust [destination, speed] (set direction + required burn)

- add other screens + navigation buttons on righthand side

- small navigation scenario
	- new navigation screen
	- direction
	- thrusters (align speed / stop)
	- destination
	- radar


- Thrusters
	- maxEnergy (like engine)
	- level (from vesselpart)
	- direction
